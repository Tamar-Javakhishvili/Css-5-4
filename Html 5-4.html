                        <p class="articleOneText">Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales,
                            this hostel has a rich history tied to mountaineering and the great outdoors.
                            Originally built as a coach inn in the late 1800s, it served travelers
                            journeying through the rugged terrain of Snowdonia.
                            What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. Over the decades,
                            it became a base for legendary climbers who tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—
                            a challenging circuit of ridges—
                            and contributed to the development of modern mountaineering in the UK.</p>

                        <p class="articleTwoText">Located in a beautifully preserved Victorian mansion built in 1885,
                            the HI Sacramento Hostel offers a glimpse into the grandeur of California's past.
                            Originally the home of a wealthy gold prospector, the mansion later
                            became a boarding house and eventually a hostel. Its elegant architecture,
                            complete with stained glass windows, carved wooden staircases,
                            and period furnishings, makes it a unique blend of history and hospitality.</p>

                        <p class="articleThreeText">Once a courthouse in the heart of London, Clink78 Hostel is steeped in
                            history.
                            Built in the 19th century, the building was where Charles Dickens worked as a court
                            reporter,
                            inspiring elements of his famous novel Oliver Twist. In the 20th century,
                            it served as a magistrates' court and famously hosted trials for punk bands like The Clash.
                            Today, the hostel preserves its legal heritage—guests can stay in refurbished prison
                            cells and relax in the courtroom-turned-lounge.</p>
